Dashcode project to post to Backpack's journal and status features.

TODO
 * make it work in Tiger
 * better success response
 * error (or silently fix and succeed?) when wrong protocol (http vs. https) is chosen
 * display current status and last journal entry on load. Maybe make it more like the web interface. Click once to expose an textfield?
